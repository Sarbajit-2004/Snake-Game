# Snake-Game
The Snake game in C tracks the snake with an array of coordinate structs. Core gameplay—movement, food, collision, scoring—is consistent on both platforms. The Windows version uses conio.h, windows.h, and system calls, while the Ubuntu version uses ncurses for cross-platform terminal control.
